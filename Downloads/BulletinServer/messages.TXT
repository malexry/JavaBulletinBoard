Raspberry Pi:I will be attempting to upload this Netbeans project to a Raspberry Pi.  I think this could run along side my web server and not take up too many resources while doing so.  This is just a neat little project me and a couple of my friends in college made in an advanced networking class for the final project.  I just resurfaced it on 6/2/2019 for fun to see if it still worked from DropBox and it does.  `malexry`Uploading my BBS Networking project to my Raspberry Pi 2
BullServer Update:I am doing some quick touch-ups before the deployment to the Raspberry Pi.  These involve makeing sure the menu elements work correctly and makeing sure that everything will continue to run if connections are not closed properly. I believe they should run just fine, fine just fine.`curtis`Pre-Pi Deployment
